## Introduction to Finite State Machines (FSMs)

Finite state machines (FSMs) are mathematical models of computation, representing abstract machines that can exist in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. These machines transition from one state to another in response to inputs, a process known as a transition. An FSM is characterized by its states, initial state, and the inputs that trigger transitions.

## Applications of FSMs

Finite state machines (FSMs) have a wide range of applications across various domains, showcasing their versatility and efficiency. In natural language processing, FSMs are utilized for sentiment analysis, effectively classifying emotions based on textual data. In digital circuit design, FSMs are crucial for creating sequential logic circuits, such as the implementation of a 4-bit counter. Moreover, FSMs are indispensable in graph theory, aiding in the identification of circuits within interconnected systems. These applications highlight the broad utility of FSMs in addressing real-world problems, providing structured models for analyzing, designing, and comprehending complex systems across different fields.
